Persisting Data With Volumes

While the container created above is a fully functioning MySQL server, 
you need to set up volumes so your data isn’t lost when the container stops. 
The MySQL Docker image is configured to store all its data in the /var/lib/mysql directory. 
Mounting a volume to this directory will 
enable persistent data storage that outlives any single container instance.
Stop and remove your earlier container to avoid naming conflicts:

docker run --name mysql -d \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=change-me \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -v mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
    mysql:8

docker exec -it mysql mysql -p
This command runs mysql -p inside the mysql container. 
The -it flags mean your terminal’s input stream will be 
forwarded to the container as an interactive TTY.
